README for Part 3

The interface for the RPC server is specified in the rpc_server.x file, as
mentioned in the top level README. The sample script rpc-voting.sh does the
same calls as the previous two. There is not as much output, so running it
all in the same terminal is fine. 

In the script, you can also comment out the local server lines and replace
the HOSTADDR, variable with the appropriate host address (I haven't tested
IP addresses directly but they should work the same)


The other details are specified in the top level README.
