README for Part 3

The interface for the RPC server is specified in the rpc_server.x file, as
mentioned in the top level README. The sample script rpc-voting.sh does the
same calls as the previous two. There is not as much output, so running it
all in the same terminal is fine. 

The other details are specified in the top level README.
