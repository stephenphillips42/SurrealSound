README

This specifies the package layouts for the UPD/TCP implementations.



ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
I used Beej's Network Guide as a reference for this code. I actually mainly used
the man pages as references, since they have good examples, but I looked at 
those pages for tips. I also used it a lot for the extra credit portion.
