README for Part 1

As specified in the top level README, the packets are layed out as follows:
Client:
<PACKET-TYPE> ":" (<ARGUEMENT1> ":" <ARGUEMENT2> ":" ...)

Server:
<PACKET-TYPE> ":" <ERROR-CODE> (":" <RETURN-VALUES>)

Also like in the top level README, the client functions are in separate files.
Use make to build everything. The file udp-voting.sh is a sample run file.
It produces a lot of output, so running the server in a separate terminal
might be a good idea, or to put its output to /dev/null/ like:
./server-udp > /dev/null/ &
(This replaces the first line)

You can also comment out the local server lines and replace the HOSTADDR
variable with the appropriate host address (I haven't tested IP addresses
directly but they should work the same)
